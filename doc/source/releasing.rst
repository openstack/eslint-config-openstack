How to release eslint-config-openstack
======================================

Only follow these steps if you have authority to release a version of eslint-config-openstack.

1. Ensure that you have gpg set up locally.
   If you do not currently have gpg installed:

   `brew install gpg gpg2`

   Set up your gpg key:

2. `git pull --ff-only`

3. `git tag -s <version number>`

4. `git push gerrit <version number>`

    Git wonâ€™t have a remote named gerrit until the first time git-review runs.
    You may need to run git review -s before the push.
