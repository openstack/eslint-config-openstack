Welcome to eslint-config-openstack developer documentation!
===========================================================

Introduction
============

OpenStack has a set of style guidelines for clarity. OpenStack is a very large
code base, spanning dozens of git trees, with over a thousand developers contributing
every 6 months. As such, common style helps developers understand code in reviews,
move between projects smoothly, and overall make the code more maintainable.

Even though eslint permits overriding rules on a per-project basis, it should be
the goal of every project to stay as close to the common guidelines as possible.
